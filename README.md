# CF Forum
> A simple forum built with ColdFusion and HTMX.

## Description
This is a simple forum built with ColdFusion and HTMX. It is a basic forum that allows users to register, login, and post messages. It is built with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

## Standards
- snake_case for ColdFusion & HTMX files
- dsp_ for display files (HTMX)
- dsp_{user}_{action}
- qry_ for SQL files
- qry_{user}_{action}
- act_ for action files 
- act_{user}_{action} 
- Markdown for documentation 
> The naming scheme for the actions and queries are to help sort the files and help you find a file more quickly. 

## Good Practice
> Setting up personal coding standards, even if you're working alone, helps you stay organized and focused on each file's purpose. Adopting consistent standards, even if they differ from work, makes it easier to adapt, maintain your code, and collaborate with others later on.
